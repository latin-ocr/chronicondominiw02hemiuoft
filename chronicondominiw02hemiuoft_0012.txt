vellum; but, with the exception of the last, are
not of a very early date. On the other hand,
MS. Lansdown, which is of higher antiquity,
apparently contemporary, concludes with the
death of Edward Ι., and attributes the whole
to Hemingburgh. MSS. C. C. C. Cant. 250, and
Stowe, 11. xlviii., the latter written in 1533,
have the Chronicle complete to the accession of
Edward ΙΙΙ., and MS. Coll. Trin. R. 5, 10,
the whole History, from the Conquest to the
Battle of Cressy. Internal evidence goes sar to
strengthen the above view. Under the year
1297, before the conclusion of any of the Manu-
scripts‚ the following expression occurs, “ by
the mediation of the venerable father, the Arch-
bishop of Canterbury, Robert de Wynchelse,
whose memory is blessed,”l which shows that
Hemingburgh was living after the death of
Robert Winchelsey, llth May, 1313,.and that
the reign of Edward Ι. was compiled at some
period subsequent to the accession of Edward
II. And in 1299 we have a direct reference
to Gisburn in the following passaget——“ The
same year, on the 17th of February, died Lord
John de Bulmer, a gallant knight, and most
estimable neighbour, and was buried at Gisburn‚
before the altar of St. John the Baptist.'' ²
