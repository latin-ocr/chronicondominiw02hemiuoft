Anno Domini M.ccxc. tenuit rex parliamentum
suum Londoniis post Pascha, ubi fecit Statuta
Westmonasterii tertia, et explanationem super
statutum Quo Warranto: in quo quidem parlia-
mento conquesti sunt magnates regi de malitia
J udaeorum et eorum perfidia, eo quod per usuras

varias et salsa scripta multos magnatum de· ι

pauperaverant, et monetam corruperant in omni
terra3 ordinatumque est per regem et secretum
consilium, quod, certo die infra horam primam
et tertiam, omnes J udaei in singulis civitatibus
caperentur et deinde expellerentur a terra3 et-

Alice, daughter of Hugh Comte
de la Marche, from whom he
afterwards separated on a plea
of consanguinity, as appears by
the dispensation of Pope Nicolas,
dated November 16, 1289.

³ Eleanor, eldest daughter of
King Edward, espoused by proxy
to Alphonso, King of Arragon,
who dying before the solemniza-
tion of the marriage, she was
united in 1294 at Bristol to Hem-y
Comte de Barr in Franee, by
whom she had issue Edward
Comte de Barr, and Joan‚ who
married John Plantagenet, Earl
os Warren, Surrey, and Sus-
sex.
