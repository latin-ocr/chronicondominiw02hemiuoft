PREFAcE. vii

The reigns of Edward II. and Edward ΙΙΙ.
cannot with an equal degree of certainty be
attributed to the same author, yet all MSS.
ascribe them to him. MS. C.C.C.C. 250,
originally had the following title, “ Cronica
Walteri de Gyseburn,'’ “ Hemingford canonici ”
has b'een overlined in a different hand. MS.
C.C.C.C. 100, is intitled “ G. de Gysburne. De
rege Edwardo Secundo.'' MS. Coll. Trin. R.
5, 10, after the close of Edw. Ι. has “De
Rege Edu-ardo Secundo ;’' and at page 317,
“ Galterus Gisburnensis de gestis regis Edwardi
tertii et caeteris Eventibus‚’' and the ancient MS.
at Magdalen Coll.‚ Oxford, is attributed to
“Gualterus Gisburne.'’ This portion of the
work is very valuable as the notes of a con·
temporary historian, and for the number os
original documents it contains.

After the year 1297 (p. 164) the text of the
present edition has been founded on MSS. Lansd.
and Coll. Trin. Cant. R. 5, 10.

The reign of Edward II. has been prepared
from MS. C.C.C.C. 250, an excellent transcript
of the commencement of the sixteenth century,
with collations from MSS. C.C.C. Cant. 100
and Coll. Trin. R. 5, 10.

The text of Edward III. is based on the MS.
in Magd. College, Oxon., MSS. Coll. Trin.
Cant. R. 5, 10, and Nero D. ii. Mus. Brit.
Reference bas also been made to Harleian 655,
a valuable manuscript of considerable antiquity,
which contains the Polychronicon of Ralph of
Chester‚ and a history of Edward ΙΙΙ., compiled
from Hemingburgh and Walsingham.

I am greatly indebted to the Rev. James
Pulling, B.D.‚ for the obliging courtesy with
which he favoured me with permission to collate
