¹ Edward II. is supposed to
have been murdered in Berkley
Castle, by John Malu-avers and
Thomas de Gurney3 the latter of
whom being discovered at Burgos
in 1331, was thrown into prison
by Alfonso of Castile, who des-
patched Ferando Ivaynes de
Greynoun to King Edward ΙΙΙ., ,
insorming him of the arrest. Ed-
ward requested that the prisoner
might be delivered up to the
Seneschal οἰ Gascony or his offi-
cers, and then examined by the
magistrates of Burgos, in pre-
sence of Bernard Pelegrym (Pil- ,

 

grim), as to the instigators and
procurers of the murder, and by
whom and in what manner it was
perpetrated. Rymer, Foedera, ii.
819, 820. Gumey was beheaded
at sea on his way to England,
on what account is not clearly
known : according to Sir Thomas
de la More, lest he might accuse
those high persons who had set
him to the work. Τ. de la More,
603, ed. eamden.

² The men of Hainault‚ whom
Edward had invited over to aid in
the expedition against Scotland.
